# **Market Sentiment Analyzer**

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)

## **Overview**

**Market Sentiment Analyzer** is a tool designed to extract data from social media platforms like **Reddit** and **Twitter**, analyze the sentiment of posts and tweets, and use that data to gauge market sentiment for financial assets, such as cryptocurrencies or stocks. The app uses the **Hugging Face API** for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify the sentiment of social media posts and provide insights into whether the market mood is positive, negative, or neutral.

## **Features**

- **Data Extraction from Social Media**: Collects posts from Twitter and Reddit using their respective APIs.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Uses Hugging Face's NLP models to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the extracted text data.
- **Live Sentiment Graph**: Displays live updates of sentiment over time in a graphical format.
- **Financial Integration**: Provides insights into market trends based on social media sentiment, useful for making trading decisions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and modern UI for displaying data, graphs, and trends.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Languages**: C++, Python (for data extraction), and wxWidgets (for GUI).
- **APIs**:
  - **Twitter API**: For collecting tweets related to financial topics.
  - **Reddit API (PRAW)**: For scraping posts from relevant subreddits.
  - **Hugging Face API**: For performing sentiment analysis on the collected text data.
- **Libraries**:
  - **libcurl**: For making HTTP requests to the APIs.
  - **wxWidgets**: To build the graphical user interface.
  - **nlohmann/json**: For parsing JSON data from the APIs.

## **Installation**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- **C++ compiler** (e.g., g++, clang)
- **wxWidgets**: For GUI.
- **libcurl**: For HTTP requests.
- **PRAW**: Python Reddit API Wrapper for Reddit data collection.
- **Tweepy**: Python library to interact with Twitter API.

### **2. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/market-sentiment-analyzer.git
cd market-sentiment-analyzer
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**

#### **a. Install wxWidgets**

Follow the instructions on the [wxWidgets website](https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/) for your specific operating system.

#### **b. Install libcurl**

For Linux:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

For macOS:
```bash
brew install curl
```

For Windows:
- Use **MSYS2** or download precompiled binaries.

#### **c. Install Python Libraries**

You'll need Python 3 and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install praw tweepy requests
```

### **4. Configure API Keys**

Before running the app, you'll need to set up the API keys:

1. **Twitter API**: Sign up at [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/) and get your API credentials.
2. **Reddit API**: Create a Reddit application at [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) to get API keys.
3. **Hugging Face API**: Sign up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and get your API key.

### **5. Configure the API Keys in Your Code**

In the `config.json` file, add your API keys:

```json
{
  "twitter_api_key": "your-twitter-api-key",
  "twitter_api_secret_key": "your-twitter-api-secret-key",
  "reddit_client_id": "your-reddit-client-id",
  "reddit_client_secret": "your-reddit-client-secret",
  "huggingface_api_key": "your-huggingface-api-key"
}
```

## **Usage**

### **1. Run the Application**

To start the application, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
./MarketTool
```

### **2. User Interface**

- **Login Screen**: Enter your username and password to access the app.
- **Main Dashboard**:
  - **Graphs**: Displays live sentiment trends based on data collected from Twitter and Reddit.
  - **Trade Panel**: View buy/sell recommendations based on the analyzed sentiment.
  - **News Panel**: Aggregated news related to the financial topics under analysis.
  - **Hugging Face Panel**: Manually input data to analyze using Hugging Face.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Data Collection**

- **Twitter**: The app uses the Twitter API to fetch tweets containing specific financial-related keywords or hashtags (e.g., `$BTC`, `#StockMarket`).
- **Reddit**: It scrapes subreddits like `r/Cryptocurrency`, `r/Stocks`, and others for discussions related to financial markets.

### **2. Sentiment Analysis**

- The app sends the collected text data to Hugging Face's NLP API, which processes the text and returns the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
  
### **3. Visualization**

- The app updates graphs in real-time, showing the sentiment trends and allowing users to understand the general market mood based on social media data.

## **Planned Features**

- **Historical Sentiment Data**: Allow users to view past sentiment trends to assist with market analysis.
- **Sentiment Alerts**: Provide real-time alerts when the sentiment changes significantly, indicating a potential market move.
- **Integration with Trading APIs**: Execute trades automatically based on sentiment analysis.
